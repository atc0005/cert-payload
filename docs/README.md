# [cert-payload][repo-url] | Docs

[HOME: Main project README](../README.md)

At present, documentation is split between several sources:

- the [main project README](../README.md)
- misc notes in the `docs` subdirectory path

## docs

This a collection of random notes that I would normally keep on a private
branch, ticketing system, wiki, etc.

Some of these details I'll likely look back at for later refactoring or to
remind myself why a particular design choice was made. The intended audience
is mostly myself, though someone looking for more of the design backstory
might be interested in the content also.
